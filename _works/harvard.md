_**Motivation**_

This project is largely concerned with system design, but most of my job as a software engineer will likely be writing application-level code in an object-oriented style. I'm interested in a conceptual framework for correct software design flexible for changes by future developers.

&nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

Jimmy Koppel notes that the most relevant field from programming language theory about thinking about software design is type theory, which is roughly be described as the study of small/toy programming languages (called “calculi”) designed to explore some kind of programming language feature. So I'm studying Benjamin Pierce's Types and Programming Languages and using this course to supplement the textbook material. This is also the only course I could find that covered sub-structural type systems, which is a key part of Rust's design.
